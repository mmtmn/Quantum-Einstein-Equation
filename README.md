The **Quantum Einstein Equation** is a proposed quantization of the classical Einstein field equations, expressing gravity in the framework of quantum mechanics. It is written as:

\[
\hat{G}_{\mu\nu} \Psi = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} \hat{T}_{\mu\nu} \Psi
\]

- **\(\hat{G}_{\mu\nu}\)**: Operator form of the Einstein tensor, representing the curvature of spacetime.
- **\(\hat{T}_{\mu\nu}\)**: Operator form of the stress-energy tensor, representing energy and momentum distribution.
- **\(\Psi\)**: Quantum state of the gravitational field.
- **\(G\)**: Gravitational constant.
- **\(c\)**: Speed of light.

This equation aims to unify general relativity and quantum mechanics by quantizing both the geometry of spacetime and the matter-energy content. By promoting the classical tensors to operators acting on a quantum state, it seeks to provide a foundation for a quantum theory of gravity.
